# ADVANCED-DATA-STRUCTURES---FINAL-PROJECT
ADVANCED DATA STRUCTURES - FINAL PROJECT


This work investigates the essential properties, operations, and applications
of binary search trees (BSTs). This fundamental data structure provides efficient access
to elements, offering operations like insertion, deletion, and search in logarithmic time
complexity. The content is primarily based on the study of Chapter 12 of the fourth
edition of the book ”Introduction to Algorithms”. A series of exercises from the book
are solved and discussed in detail, providing a practical understanding of BSTs. The
problems cover various aspects such as insertion, deletion, and Querying binary search
trees. The project aims to enhance my understanding of the concept, providing a robust
foundation for further exploration of more complex tree structures.
Keywords: Binary Search Trees, Data Structures, Algorithms, Insertion, Deletion, Search,
